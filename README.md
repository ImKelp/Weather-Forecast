# Weather-Forecast
A rudimentary weather app built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This is my first webdev project. The code quality and logic might not be up to standard, however, the goal was to understand how to update html elements from a javascript file, and style it accordingly.

The empty areas of the page were left like that because the project become too complex. Truth be told, I tried to design a use for the empty spaces in figma but it repeatedly ended up looking subpar relatively speaking.
